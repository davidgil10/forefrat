    < class >So, I thought I'd write you a love letter today because  when you have a wife who offers solutions to global problems like "Where did the lid for the pot go?" or "How do you open an aggressively jumpy can?"<br>
     – you just have to celebrate her!

    Whether you're always bringing answers that weigh no less than  
    a reduced algebraic expression or simply giving my hand a bone-crushing squeeze when I try to sort out the hazardous cargo in the car – you always find a way to turn life into something exciting and hilarious.
    
    I don't know how it happens, but even after eight years together, every time you smile at me, the world suddenly fills with colors and songs. I'm looking forward to many more years of adventures together, filled with funny stories and memories that will grow like wildflowers in fertile soil.
    
    I love you, even when you manage to magically extract money from my wallet with that  irresistible middle-of-the-aisle face that's just impossible to resist.
    
    Hugging you with all my heart,
    
    </span>
